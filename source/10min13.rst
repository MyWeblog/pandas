Gotchas
-------

If you are trying an operation and you see an exception like:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> if pd.Series([False, True, False]):
        print("I was true")
    Traceback
        ...
    ValueError: The truth value of an array is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.any() or a.all().

See :ref:`Comparisons<basics.compare>` for an explanation and what to do.

See :ref:`Gotchas<gotchas>` as well.
