Pandas Doc
==========
Pandas Doc re-rendered using RTD theme, and html's structured to my own liking.

.. important:: Content directly from official documentation page from (`pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable//>`__. This page created since I love the readthedoc Sphinx theme.

- Pandas version = 0.18
- ``|today|`` = |today|
- All modules for which code is available (`link <./_modules/index.html>`_)
